          <h2>What other problems could the car have?</h2>
          <h3>Buying a car is a big investment. It is important to check the following:

Is there a debt owing on the car? If you buy a car with money owing on it, you can be made to repay the original debt.

Is the seller the legal owner? Make sure the car you are buying is not stolen.

When you buy a car from Turners, we guarantee that the car is not stolen and you will not have to pay if there is an unpaid finance debt on a car bought from us.
This is called clear title. </h3>
